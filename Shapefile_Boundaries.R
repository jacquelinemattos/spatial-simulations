#### Densify the convex hull ####
#If you want more than just the vertices of the convex hull (i.e., points along the edges), you can "densify" the polygon by adding more points along its boundary. You can use the st_segmentize() function to add evenly spaced points


# Add additional points along the convex hull's edges (e.g., every 1 km)
convex_hull_densified <- st_segmentize(hull, dfMaxLength = 1000)  # 1000 meters
densified_coords <- st_coordinates(convex_hull_densified)

# Save coordinates to a CSV file
